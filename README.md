# First Project

This is my first Git and GitHub practice project.

# Description

In this project, I wrote down the Git commands I used to create and modify files step by step.

# Steps

Create a new folder

# mkdir First


Change the working directory

# cd First

Initialize a new Git repository
This command tells Git to start tracking changes in the folder.

# git init


Stage and commit the first file

# git add check.txt
# git commit -m "My first line"


Stage and commit the second file

# git add .gitignore
# git commit -m "My second line"


Stage and commit the third file

# git add README.md
# git commit -m "My third line"


Push the project to the GitHub repository

# git push -u origin main


# Thank you
