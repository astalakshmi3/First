# First Project

This is my first Git and GitHub practice project.

# Description

In this project, I wrote down the Git commands I used to create and modify files step by step.

# Steps

# Create a new folder

 mkdir First


# Change the working directory

 cd First

# TASK 1

# 1. Initialize a new  local Git repository
This command tells Git to start tracking changes in the folder.

 git init

Creates a new Git repository in my project folder.

# 2. Create file and mAKE THE FIRST COMMIT

Add the file to Staging and commit the first file.

 git add check.txt
 git commit -m "My first line"


Add the file to Stage and commit the second file.

 git add .gitignore
 git commit -m "My second line"


Add the file to Stage and commit the third file.

 git add README.md
 git commit -m "My third line"

# 3. Connect to GitHub and push

 git branch -M main
 git remote add origin <url>
 git push -u origin main

Links my local repo to my GitHub repository and uploads it.

# 4. Track more changes

git add README.md
git comitt -m "Written the commands"

Task 2
